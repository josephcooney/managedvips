Note that I've assumed some things about the `VipsImage` class and its properties, as well as the `VIPS_ROUND_UP` function. You may need to modify these to match your actual implementation.

Also note that this code uses the `GPrivate` class from the `System.Threading` namespace, which is not actually a part of the .NET Framework. I've replaced it with a simple `object` key-value pair, but you may want to use a more robust solution depending on your needs.

Finally, I've removed some of the commented-out code and unused variables to make the code easier to read. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
